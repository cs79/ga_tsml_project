## Project notes

Can use MCMC (possibly) to either "test against" in some fashion (e.g. see how a trained model performs against random simulated data), or to even train a model if it is a computer-vision model (as long as the MCMC output was in the same format and "reasonably" scaled to actual movement -- could class out different 'types' of movements for differently-volatile stocks, perhaps)
